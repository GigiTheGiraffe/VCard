                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I am an enthusiastic learner at BeCode, having previously earned my bachelor's degree in psychology. My passion lies in web development, and I particularly enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My ambition is to become a full stack developer, and BeCode provides the perfect environment for me to achieve this goal. This company specializes in reskilling individuals for careers in web development through practical, hands-on training. I am dedicated to gaining as much knowledge and experience as possible during my time at BeCode, with the aim of becoming a proficient junior web developer by the end of the program.</p>
